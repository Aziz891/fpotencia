<a id="what-is-fpotencia" class="anchor" href="#what-is-fpotencia" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is fPotencia?</h1>

<p>fPotencia is a library for positive sequence power flow simulations.
fPotencia is specifically designed to be used as a library, it is made to allow you to run it in
parallel taking the most of your simulation hardware. It is implemented in C++ because at the
moment C++ seems to be the most popular high performance language.</p>

<h1>
<a id="programming-environments" class="anchor" href="#programming-environments" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming environments</h1>

<p>I have tried to keep fPotencia as cross-platform as possible. Standard C++ is itself cross platform,
that means that with an adequate compiler you can have the library working in the operative
system of your choice. The code is written using the C++11 standard.
Since I work with Windows and Linux machines and I do not own an Apple computer, I will
only be giving examples and instructions for Windows and Linux. The examples and instructions
might be taken as some sort of guidance for the rest of platforms.
Specifically, in Linux I develop using Netbeans (v8.0.x) with its C/C++ plug-in, and in
Windows I develop using visual studio 2013 or Netbeans as well. You will find both IDE projects
in the fPotencia folder along with the code.
The code { src } and libraries { libs } are kept separated from the diverse projects, this
means that the libraries and the code are common to all the provided IDE projects.</p>

<h1>
<a id="installing-the-dependencies" class="anchor" href="#installing-the-dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing the dependencies</h1>

<p>fPotencia depends on some external libraries to handle the linear algebra operations with complex
numbers.
<strong>Eigen:</strong> is a powerful linear algebra library.</p>

<p>• Windows: If you use the Visual Studio project or the Netbeans project, then you don’t
need to do anything. Eigen will be automatically included. You will find Eigen in the
folder blow.
<code>&lt;fPotencia folder&gt;/libs/eigen3</code></p>

<p>• Linux(Ubuntu): You can install Eigen through the package manager:
<code>sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev.</code>
If you cannot find a package for your distribution, then just add the Eigen folder to you
C++ project. By adding the libs folder to your C++ project in the Includes field of the
project configuration.</p>

<a id="compiling-f-potencia" class="anchor" href="#compiling-f-potencia" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compiling f Potencia</h1>

<p>fPotencia is written in standard C++ 2011, this means that you are supposed to be able to compile
it under any architecture if using the correct compiler.
For the production of it I have used indiscriminately the gcc compiler under Linux and
the gcc compiler provided by the MinGW project under Windows (They are supposed to be the
same). As development environment I use Netbeans 8.0+ and I provide both Linux and Windows
Netbens projects to help you start. I you prefer another IDE, it should be straight forward to
include the code since you just need to include all the files in the <code>/src</code> folder. There are no special
configurations, all the steps are explained in this document.</p>

<h1>
<a id="using-fpotencia-in-your-project" class="anchor" href="#using-fpotencia-in-your-project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using fPotencia in your project</h1>

<p>fPotencia itself is compiled as a static library. <code>fpotencia.a</code> in Linux, and <code>fpotencia.lib</code> in
Windows. I was investigating about the difference of dynamic and static libraries and I couldn’t
find a good reason to not having it static, but of course you are free to compile it as you want.</p>

<h2>
<a id="visual-studio" class="anchor" href="#visual-studio" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Visual Studio</h2>

<p>Visual Studio is only available for Windows.
In the project menu page:
<code>project configuration {menu} &gt; configuration properties &gt; VC++ Directories&gt;</code></p>

<p>• <code>Include directories</code> : Directories of the header files used in your project (yes, the
directory where the fPotencia headers are).
• <code>Library directories</code> : Directory where fpotencia.lib is located.</p>

<h2>
<a id="netbeans" class="anchor" href="#netbeans" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Netbeans</h2>

<p>Netbeans is available for both Windows and Linux.
In the project menu page:
project configuration <code>{menu} &gt; Build &gt;</code>
• <code>C++ Compiler &gt; Include directories</code> : Directories of the header files used in your
project (yes, the directory where the fpotencia headers are). For example <code>../../../src;</code>
<code>../../../libs</code> for fPotencia as you find it in the GIT repository.
• <code>Linker &gt; Libraries</code> : Select the file fpotencia.lib if you are under Windows or
fpotencia.a if you are under Linux.</p>

<p>The link below explains how to configure MinGW (GCC for Windows) to work with Netbeans.
<code>http://wiki.netbeans.org/HowToCreate64-BitC/C++WindowsProgram</code>
When using MinGW (64 bits) under windows, you must set the compiler additional options
to <code>-static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++</code>otherwise the compiled program will not
work as expected.</p>
